2 . 
oh , oh ! 
oh , oh ! 
oh , oh ! 
let us remember , Mr. Speaker , that these segments of our society form the backbone of our economy . 
hear , hear ! 
hear , hear ! 
Mr. Speaker , my question is directed to the Minister of Transport . 
both have many years experience in the manufacture and distribution of forest products . 
1 . 
another point I should like to discuss is the right of the supplier to choose his customers as he sees fit . 
i am getting sick and tired of ministers who seem to have some hang - up with regard to the collective bargaining process . 
there is just one specific item more that I would like to comment upon and then I will sit down , Mr. Speaker . 
order , please . 
3 . 
i can refer him to no better authority on the subject than the hon. member for Don Valley , not just myself . 
it is quite understandable . 
in addition , it could become a serious threat to Confederation and national unity . 
in view of this , we deemed it inadvisable to attend the meeting and so informed COJO . 
Mr. Speaker , the minister suggested that a greater building program might lead to inflationary pressure . 
i disagree with the argument advanced by the minister . 
there is a lot to be said on both sides of that question . 
order . 
Mr. Speaker , as I indicated to the Leader of the Opposition , I would hope to make an announcement on this question on November 1 . 
quite right . 
it does not bring anybody closer to rehabilitation to isolate him from the public . 
he left a wife and family . 
on a point of order , Mr. Chairman , I am sure the hon. member for Verdun would not have denigrated my position . 
can the insurance industry in turn act as an airline ? 
i say this to you , Mr. Speaker : the people of Toronto know the government has no answers . 
their evidence on the state of each stock was taken fully into account . 
thank you very much , Mr. Speaker , and I thank hon. members for allowing me the privilege to continue . 
i urge this intensive study , Mr. Speaker , for we know so little about the reasons that turn people into criminals . 
the government must assist its own employees who may need another language to advance their careers . 
i do not have any qualms about the type of language I use . 
motion agreed to . 
Mr. Speaker , no decision has been reached as yet but I should think so . 
the matter of trade relations with our European counterparts should be very seriously considered . 
what we should be concerned with in this country is the situation when these animals are shipped out of Canada for this purpose . 
they have already given an indication of the branches they intend to close . 
this minister watched while half the proceeds and profits of the Canadian agriculture industry were swept away in a budget speech . 
Mr. Chairman , absolutely none . 
we are analysing the report now and I hope to have some information for the House in the near future . 
hear , hear ! 
hear , hear ! 
i would therefore move , seconded by the hon. member for Dartmouth - Halifax East ( Mr. Forrestall ) : 
when we realize the extent of the ravages caused by organized crime in our country , we must consider deep - rooted solutions . 
but oh how their popularity soared and they coasted through on that . 
( 2 ) A committee is bound by , and not at liberty to depart from , the order of reference . 
there is one other point I should like to make , and I do so as I feel this is a general debate . 
in December there was an announcement that British Columbia would be withdrawing from CEMA . 
they have also given rise to considerable opposition by hon. members in all parties on this side of the House . 
those are not the lines that one should be concerned about at this time . 
i have allowed the hon. member two supplementaries and in fairness I think we should go to some other hon. members . 
i think that is good . 
i think that the time taken in handling routine applications for changes of facilities along a pipeline , for example , has been too long . 
he is the minister who is responsible for science and technology , and he does not know . 
federal government carpenters get $ 6.42 in Toronto and $ 5.23 in Halifax and Moncton . 
for the record I would like to refer to a press release which followed the federal - provincial conference of attorneys general in October , 1975 . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i think the railroad term is « demand loading » . 
i will come to the cost of boats these days . 
in most provinces , general noise regulations have been implemented , the main principle of which is as follows : 
agreed . 
after all , energy is used by people throughout the nation , and the government might well consider an approach using the incentive to which I have referred . 
6 . 
i will be glad , when we have time , to sit down with hon. members and work this matter out on a productive and prospective basis . 
will the minister take action to clear up any difficulties because of the absolute need for placing the orders now , and not some months from now ? 
it will spur the construction of new fishing boats and cause new processing facilities to be built . 
there are many things I could say about Bill C - 19 . 
i am going to say something a bit later on about that because I think it is essential to the kind of debate we are having this afternoon . 
companies find that the rules are complicated , cumbersome and changing all the time . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister in charge of the Canadian Wheat Board . 
i understand that a rate of at least 70 per cent per annum is being contemplated . 
it is our hope to make a decision this week . 
we accept your view . 
they fought an election on that position . 
12 . 
Mr. Speaker , I say to that : what a cruel hoax , because a hoax it is . 
Mr. Speaker , we will try to stick to that suggestion . 
1 . ( a ) $ 98,355 . ( b ) They are distributed through major post offices across the country . 
crime is a national problem according to our constitution , while law enforcement is a provincial and local responsibility . 
i submit that what I say is pertinent to the bill , to moneys being spent on medicare and the manner in which they are spent . 
a few words about this disease might help to put things into perspective . 
fortunately they are fewer this year , more reasonable and responsible , more conciliatory . 
this bill has been before the House for more than a year . 
retired December 30 , 1975 following completion of 34 years of public service . 
passage of the hon. member 's motion would mean that the content requirements are spelled out in the statute and we could debate them . 
this does not necessarily indicate non - compliance on the part of the parties . 
i was not asking for a detailed explanation as to what he was doing . 
how can so much be asked , on the one hand , and so little answered on the other ? 
as a result , perhaps he will bring in different legislation which will not lay him open to the charge of censorship . 
either they do their job properly , or you must get the power so that you can be sure that they do it properly . 
in our national capital we have all the strains and all the divergencies of our country . 
hon. John N . Turner ( Minister of Finance ) moved : 
as much as I hate to admit it , there has been good legislation brought in by Liberal governments in this country -- 
as the member for the neighbouring riding I am well aware of his persistence and hard work . 
where is the AIB ? 
at the moment , that fact , unfortunately , is seen in two - thirds of the country not as an opportunity , but as a barrier to opportunity . 
do not force a moratorium down our throats . 
this not the first time that members of parliament are going to hear that . 
the same recommendation was made in the report of the Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections on April 29 of last year . 
Mr. Speaker , I am afraid the hon. member is ill informed . 
in the MOT accident report it is stated : 
Mr. Speaker , the federal offer was for a $ 100 million program . 
in most samples of this size -- that is , a group of over 500 -- this would be called negligible . 
the traditional procedure for seeking new borrowing powers is to attach a clause to supply bills brought before the House . 
this strikes at the roots of democracy , and it is the right of the people to know . 
this would relieve the pressure on oil . 
the Special Investigation Division has not been in existence since early 1975 . 
moreover , this is not a matter of saying whether we are for or against some sort of assistance for adoptive parents . 
let us see the documents . 
canada has continued to give its support to the NATO alliance as an absolutely indispensable deterrent and an absolutely indispensable assurance of our security . 
can you believe such a ban in 1978 ? 
no , Mr. Chairman . 
naturally , the government attempts to get the best possible deal for the Canadian public in any series of negotiations . 
i would add , Mr. Speaker , that it must be continued . 
if I want any statistics as to where this country stands , certainly I will not refer to the speech made by the Prime Minister . 
we looked at all the implications of that . 
perhaps it would be a good idea for me to quote a Timmins newspaper because maybe it relates to the hon. member . 
Mr. Speaker , indeed I have the final report from the Prairie Rail Action Committee . 
( ii ) ( a ) Three vehicles will be used by six Canadian experts related to the provision of technical assistance . 
1979 . 
and we will implement every recommendation in the Auditor General 's report , something which we have been calling for over the last ten years . 
first , Mr. Speaker , I should like to make a few general remarks . 
Mr. Chairman , I will see if there is such a figure available , but I would quarrel with the words of the hon. member . 
i know he would not want to divert me from responding to a very serious question by his colleague . 
continually we get the message from across the way that this program will cost the government something . 
that is the crowd which did not like the 18 cents . 
what is at issue here is the principle that the public of Canada has a right to know about the constitution of Canada . 
they want to pick and choose what they will support . 
do you have it in writing ? 
i realize , Mr. Chairman , that there is no magic solution . 
in 1978 Americans divorced 1,122,000 times . 
the very result of unemployment breaks up families , and contributes to excessive alcohol and drug use . 
the official opposition was trying to destroy Petro - Canada in the short six months it was in office . 
instead of causing an internal schism , 
and now they are applauding themselves for voting against security of supply . 
as to making contributions , I am reminded of a story . 
madam Speaker , I would like to hear from the hon. member before I move my motion . 
the previous speaker also mentioned they would like to have the provinces involved in preparations for any meetings . 
my friend from Toronto says 53 more years . 
all of those estimates indicate that Canada will be in much more trouble as a result of the National Energy Program than we were in before . 
Mr. Prime Minister : 
indeed , there will be more divisiveness than positive effects . 
world - wide inflation is causing a severe form of economic dislocation . 
the PT7 represents the beginning of a new family of engines in a power range above that of the highly successful PT6 engine . 
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the opportunity to join in this adjournment debate -- 
the competition policy is as vital to an industrial strategy as the over - all plan or the specific set of plans which should be developed . 
we are now talking about $ 45 billion to construct the pipeline . 
these flaws are all reflected in this bill . 
at this stage of the debate of the resolution , there are three specific amendments which my party proposes to introduce . 
the government cannot claim that there is any change in the balance of ways and means . 
a substantial provision of federal assistance for regional development comes under this program , RIDA , and subsidiary units . 
what did the government do ? 
he said that if we use unemployment as the solution to inflation , we will get recovery . 
conservation is beginning to have its effect . 
there could be a steel mill in British Columbia , for example . 
order , please . 
that is why professionals should not be charged for their work in progress . 
i believe , Mr. Speaker , that what is happening today is a good thing but it is just the beginning . 
however , the people of Canada are responsible for making those payments . 
we are now faced with legislation that is designed to withdraw from programs that were introduced at a time when we could afford them . 
that is why we had to import 25,000 skilled workers into this country at a time when unemployment was rising . 
as Carter said back in the 1960s , « A buck is a buck is a buck » and should be taxed as such . 
order , please . 
all of this means a total cut over the next two years of $ 2,958 , or 15 per cent of the original $ 20,000 salary . 
we heard in the news this morning that the Heath - Steele mine in northern New Brunswick is being closed down . 
they are ready to follow our leadership . 
we have a number of those kinds of programs and discussions going on at the present moment . 
out of that momentum of ideas and activity , we have to ask ourselves , why has the development problem not been solved ? 
i would like to end on a positive note , Mr. Speaker . 
i want to make it plain , Mr. Speaker , that the federal government does not set retail prices . 
the House met at 2 p.m. 
i remind hon. members that the minister in respect of transmission lines referred to the same power that now exist . 
that is truly a laudable goal with which we all agree . 
madam Speaker , I have a supplementary question for the Minister of Transport . 
let me come now to Petro - Canada . 
this will result in tremendous savings . 
unfortunately , no one seems to know what the effect will be . 
we have allowed a subgovernment across the country to remove power from the House of Commons . 
that is quite substantial . 
what exactly is going on over there ? 
madam Speaker , I will be very brief . 
that Government simply tells the people what is good for them . 
it is the seasonally adjusted figures which show the .5 per cent drop which are the important figures . 
the Chair is really embarrassed by what is taking place . 
Mr. Speaker , I am sorry , I have not seen the statement by a British firm . 
fewer volunteers are available because so many women have returned to the work force . 
they work with them . 
it depends on the extent to which they apply themselves . 
i do not know if there is a Member in this House who would oppose allocating more money for the elderly . 
they also have a role to play in the food chain . 
this has given a more democratic element to the things we were faced with in our constituency . 
the problem is to obscure the memories of everyone who heard the Minister 's stupid statements of a week ago . 
will the Ministry fill in the ravine at the end of runway 24L at the Pearson International Airport at Toronto ? 
if we ever introduce such legislation , I will remind him of his offer . 
my response is , so what ? 
this , Sir , is what I recommend to the House . 
whether that will do any good , I do not know . 
that is the principle which must guide the Alliance in the future as we seek fair and verifiable agreements with the Soviet Union . 
i guess the same kind of answer would have to apply to the matter of automobiles . 
they are bringing before the House a Bill that will restrict those liberties . 
for debate , the Hon. Member for Bow River ( Mr. Taylor ) . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
the Government refuses to believe it . 
those were very challenging commitments , a sort of preview of what the very important agricultural sector might become . 
there are two revolving - door syndrome and gating . 
i hope he will be back with that mobilized public opinion . 
i think the argument being made by the Government is faulty . 
however , we do have enough money to bail out two banks . 
order . 
it can be stolen just as other types of property can be stolen . 
and , second , Mr. Speaker , what we have been doing since last November is building up a climate of confidence . 
members should know that credit unions are a very big factor in financial institutions in western Canada . 
the Member for Cochrane - Superior ( Mr. Penner ) said earlier tonight that the onus is on the Government to free up its Members . 
that is my point . 
what of women who live far from centres where these services are available ? 
they ask the Members of this House to put an end to all cuts in personnel at these shops . 
it is not a question of joining ; we are well ahead . 
in an article written by Dr. Kenneth Hare , recognized in this country as being one of our foremost atmospheric scientists , the following appears : 
the impact is pervasive . 
in other words , a subsidy of about $ 2 per bushel will come from the Reagan administration to the grain farmers of the United States . 
the full report will be coming in before the fall . 
if these rules were put in place , would we indeed be treating everyone in the same way ? 
in them this former distinguished Speaker of the House talked about sexual harassment where some women had to disrobe to qualify for their jobs . 
i am simply alerting Members to a problem that I see , given what has been happening . 
the Conservatives while in Opposition , of course , said quite the contrary to what they are doing now . 
in point of fact , both the Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General have responded fully , as best human beings can . 
does the Deputy Prime Minister believe that this is the way for a responsible Government , or an independent nation , to make an international treaty ? 
the parliamentary subcommittee is considering the whole question of equality rights . 
the fact is that no applications involving fewer than four student employees is being subjected to any test of whether or not the jobs are career oriented . 
we also want a series of objective criteria based on factors such as those I am referring to . 
if we proceed on that basis in this or in any other direction in public life , we will always be able to find excuses . 
then you brought in your program , the hotel went down the tube and Fort St. John became a ghost town . 
well , in six months , we did consult , we sat down with the Minister and hammered out an agreement . 
the Right Hon. Member might disagree with her perspective as well . 
" let us try it , " they say , " and see if it works . 
approximately $ 3 million of this amount is allocated from DREE funds , with the remainder being committed by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development . 
it cannot be stressed too often that Canadians are disturbed by the increase in violent crime . 
grain exports are projected to fall by 25 per cent in the 1984 - 85 crop year . 
we are so far behind in this field it makes the whole country feel embarassed . 
they do not really change the status . 
there is no longer any distinction to be made on a rational basis between an intermediate range and an intercontinental range nuclear missile . 
could I ask the Member for Western Arctic for a brief answer , if possible . 
greater Victoria is a tourist mecca . 
that tax will not be collected and then refunded . 
there has been a commitment in the past that their participation rate would go at least to historic levels if not traditional levels . 
that is to say , at the request of the person who may be going to declare his refugee claim . 
that is the actual situation . 
equalization payments have become quite considerable through the years . 
it has been a matter of concern to representatives of all parties . 
i would also like to advise the House that there was a degree of consultation with respect to the PC caucus members from Manitoba . 
the part played by military personnel and their families in the life of the town will be long remembered in a most favourable light . 
with great respect , I must interrupt . 
i explained it then . 
if the Prime Minister said that he was willing to resume negociations with Quebec , why are they in such a hurry to pass this Bill ? 
in fact , that is why a number of my colleagues have spoken out quite vigorously on the subject . 
i should like to put on the record just exactly what is in the notes on the financial statement of March 31 , 1984 . 
that judgment is sent to the individual in question . 
that does not make sense . 
Mr. Speaker , many authorities were involved in acting on this emergency . 
however , what happened to the studies that were conducted after that incident occurred ? 
there was a clear understanding by the former Minister of Transport that these regulations would not be promulgated for a year . 
i feel that is an attitude in Cabinet which we do not have the luxury of allowing to continue . 
in other words , Mr. Speaker , the Government must implement the recommendations of the Commissioner of Official Languages . 
they will then reduce the number of jobs because what they buy will be a duplication of other operations they have . 
it is at the second stage of review that the Supreme Court has ruled that a hearing is compulsory . 
as for lawyers specialized in immigration matters , the Bar takes upon itself to penalize them . 
the alternative in terms of foreign investment is loan capital . 
does he want to wait until the economy of those rural areas is completely down before responding to the acid rain problem ? 
i think that should not be too difficult to understand . 
however , we must not forget that the majority of beef and pork producers have rejected outright any mechanisms for marketing stabilization . 
if I had been in Bryce 's position , I would have been right in there with my nose to the public trough with the rest of them . 
in other words , we consider that the political role and the administrative role should be kept separate . 
as a result , the Government had to take steps to see that the company was taken over . 
all of these heritage places are managed by Parks Canada for the benefit and enjoyment of all Canadians . 
as I indicated earlier in this ruling , such discrimination was not envisaged in the Bill when it was given second reading . 
there is a role for both the public and the private sector . 
there will be more criticism , perhaps , because this Government , as I understand it , is committed to making things more open to the public . 
that is not good enough . 
he was the one who told us that the construction of a maintenance centre for VIA Rail in Montreal would be indefinitely postponed . 
but then Mr. Baldwin said : 
we want full public disclosure of company commitments involved in take - overs of Canadian business . 
there is also a need to co - ordinate with provincial Governments as to what certain areas require . 
they are of the opinion that by just changing the name from FIRA to Investment Canada we are going to have an automatic inflow of dollars . 
can the Minister tell this House what position the Canadian Government will take in this regard ? 
it is nine months since the election of this Government and we have yet to see a Budget . 
we currently allow the Canadian amateur athletic associations to be registered , and it is my belief that we should allow the provincial groups as well to be registered . 
a Canadian amateur athletic association by definition includes federal associations but does not include their provincial counterparts . 
to this battle Canada gave 1,800 gallant sailors and 24 proud ships . 
i find it incredible that the President of the Treasury Board would be laughing about a matter as serious as this . 
they have also asked for additional funding . 
well , everyone would agree with that . 
it is no wonder that there was no permanent chief executive officer for over 12 months . 
the Minister spoke of meetings and I applaud that . 
we had to put that in St. John 's . 
that is an accurate description of what is happening . 
they cannot be treated in isolation . 
he obviously does not like the co - op people in eastern Canada . 
the federal Government has a responsibility to be a policing agent . 
it wants to increase the percentage of its part - time workers to 45 per cent of its total work force . 
in the last Manitoba provincial election , 900 mail - in votes were received and were mostly from urban voters . 
what does basic common sense say ? 
standards are actually stricter in abattoirs built according to Quebec regulations . 
technicians make more than the writers and playwrights whose works are being performed . 
they were all leftists . 
it is well done . 
yes , we are a small nation and we are vulnerable because of our size . 
Mr. Wyman has many years of experience in the financial market sector . 
let 's think about that for just a moment . 
i do not think we should beat around the bush any longer about how to set things right . 
it says that resource impact funding helps Indian people to get a piece of the action . 
one of the major objectives of these consultations is to make sure that the recovery benefits all . 
Mr. Speaker , I think that in his speech , the Hon. Member from Baie - Comeau misrepresented reality . 
it is a matter of elementary justice that women 's jobs be fairly evaluated . 
we intend to continue this discussion with the benefit of the views of a wide range of interested parties . 
i think particularly of single parents . 
the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion treats all matters related to Quebec with a great deal of fairness and honesty . 
as a matter of fact that net farm income reached its lowest level since 1970 and the third lowest level since 1938 , some 45 years ago . 
in the Laval - Deux - Montagnes area , $ 225,000 was spent in 1984 but only $ 30,000 will be spent this year Mr. Speaker . 
this particular Minister made personal election promises that he would not only consult with fishermen but that he would be readily available when problems arise . 
that investment is being neglected , primarily in British Columbia . 
the outstanding issue has been the failure to make a funding commitment for the ERDA agreement . 
he should come clean on this issue this afternoon instead of giving us all this gobbledy - gook . 
he said that British Telecom « has not demonstrated its marketing savvy or product management ability » . 
foreign investment was running Canada as though it were the fifty - first State . 
it does not conduct research and development . 
the first question is : why does agriculture require stabilization ? 
as a general rule , all the producers of any given commodity are affected simultaneously by a cost - price squeeze . 
we have a diversified riding . 
so the real problem is that farmers are leaving farming . 
let us go to the question of what the public seems to be saying on this issue of Senate reform . 
as this is what is required , it is the target the Government has in mind . 
that , I believe , we all find unacceptable , regardless of political Party . 
let me return to the Bill which is before us . 
it is a mistake to do what the Tories are proposing to do to differentiate their Bill . 
we know how painful that can be for people who are going through a period of their life which is not particularly joyful . 
the establishment of such a system should therefore be a priority in each province where it does not already exist . 
we have been colleagues for a long time . 
it will help Canadian companies to accelerate their return to a healthy financial position by attracting new equity investment . 
the universal family allowance is maintained . 
research is a low priority . 
oh ? 
there are increased costs for shampoo and drinks for kids , pet food , gas , and even heating the home . 
this technique is not unusual on the basis of precedents . 
similarly , under the last Liberal Budget , personal income increased in 1984 by 7 per cent . 
but the Government treats itself to lavish spending and engages in bailing out corporations . 
there will be improved survivor benefit regulations for women , standards for pension benefit splitting on marriage breakdown , and equality standards . 
in fact , if one adds in some other things resulting from the Western Accord , I think it is more likely to be 2.8 cents per litre . 
we follow through with our election pledges . 
we must revive our economy , create jobs , rationalize government spending , administer with increased efficiency . 
it does not make a lot of sense , particularly when you look at who is paying . 
what will they do with that capital ? 
that is roughly equal to the $ 440 million paid to Canadair in two years . 
from these hearings , it became obvious that the major concern was capital gains . 
it indicates to individual Canadians that for too long Government has made their decisions for them . 
that brings to mind the hundreds of young Canadians I met recently , most of them quite disillusioned . 
this is why I cannot find myself supportive of the request for additional funding for the Government by way of borrowing . 
the Hon. Member says : « neglected Quebec » , and I agree . 
i was glad to hear that Crown corporations with a commercial value but no ongoing public policy purpose will be sold . 
we have taken these considerations very much into account when we designed the Budget . 
will the Prime Minister live up to that commitment ? 
can the Minister clarify the effect of the reduction ? 
thus far , I have been describing the physical aspects of my constituency . 
we believe they will accept the challenge . 
can he tell them that is fair ? 
it has been years and years since our business community got such a vote of confidence from Government . 
the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada is providing the opposition . 
they stood to a person and applauded loudly . 
eight . 
no , Mr. Speaker , not quite . 
i would like now to go into the theory behind the removal of capital gains tax . 
it will increase poverty in the most vulnerable people , senior citizens , who will not be able to go out and find other sources of income . 
CFB Moose Jaw is also the home of the Snowbirds , Canada 's aerobatic air team . 
our caucus heard the other day from the Atlantic provinces economic council . 
come on , give us a break ! 
that is one major problem . 
i wish to direct the majority of my comments today to the many improvements offered in the pension programs available to all Canadians . 
furthermore , the erosion of the cost base of assets by inflation was also regarded as something that should be compensated for . 
the Budget is realistic because it takes a balanced and sensible approach . 
that is not the interest or concern of this Government . 
they voted for a change in the national affairs of our nation . 
on a point of order , Mr. Speaker . 
the facts are clear . 
the motion of the Hon. Member for Beaches therefore gives us an opportunity to do in this House what everyone else is now doing throughout the country . 
they also have a technical library , and the company spends nearly $ 2 million annually on these research services . 
second , we want to assist Canadian businesses to exploit opportunities for investment and technological advancement . 
not only are the risks greater but the time required to prepare for marine re - supply is lengthy . 
Mr. Speaker , once again the Liberal and NDP forecasters of economic doom and gloom have been proven wrong . 
i am not going to bother boring the House with those answers again . 
however , when we came into office we discovered that the trend line was going up . 
only the document cited need to be tabled by a Minister . 
furthermore , there is the provision in our resolution of having had to serve for a period in excess of 365 days in Canada as the basis of eligibility . 
the Government said that it had not had time to talk to either group about that proposal . 
in other words , the writing is on the wall . 
they were saying that homeowners would lose again because interest rates were rising . 
our international role has somehow collapsed . 
for instance , if we look at crop insurance , the federal Government has put up half the premiums and the producers have put up the other half . 
so we cannot think in those terms . 
the Minister has said that the only problem with Candu and the whole nuclear power option is a marketing one . 
why was it that I was receiving those kind of representations ? 
» that is what the present Prime Minister told the former Prime Minister . 
most of them are unable to work . 
a few days ago my colleague from Essex - Windsor gave the House a history lesson . 
the article reads : 
he said that he was burning oil . 
the Government has yet to come to the point of determining how and when this change should take place . 
i referred earlier to the bet taken up by the Prime Minister ( Mr. Mulroney ) concerning employment as related to immigration . 
however , we see in the legislation before us today only two substantive amendments and a number of housekeeping amendments to the Bill . 
we as a society cannot afford to discriminate among individuals on that sort of basis . 
this type of federal - provincial co - operation is required to increase the sensitivity and efficiency of our current disease surveillance systems . 
he suggested that June at least would be a better time . 
in 1934 , the company was renamed the Northern Transportation Company Limited , still under private ownership . 
i do commend the Minister of Transport for following through on the original terms of reference . 
then and only then does the private sector rush in saying that it cannot have all these publicly - owned corporations interfering in the private sector . 
specialty services such as stand - by supply vessels for the Beaufort Sea oil and gas industry can be provided by others . 
unfortunately or fortunately , however one views the issue , that particular Minister has not met with very much success . 
however , perhaps the Chair could dispose of Motion No. 1 . 
on the west coast we have the Minister 's Advisory Committee which , while not perfect , is at least of assistance . 
this is a fine example of a partnership in progress between government and industry . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is directed to the Minister of Transport . 
Mr. Speaker , let me be clear . 
within the Government of Canada , a number of Departments have been actively involved and have been proceeding in a co - operative and coordinated fashion . 
however , the contradiction between what he said and what has been said by his officials requires further independent investigation . 
i know that we are trying to do it , at the federal level through the Farm Credit Corporation . 
these are key economic indicators . 
production is being expanded with the development of a sixth farm at Bowden Institution in Alberta . 
that was the principle of the Bill as passed on second reading . 
surely no one , and particularly no member of the Conservative Party , would believe that . 
the people of Canada did that on September 4 . 
call in the Members . 
we think that now is the time for the regulations and procedures to be properly established . 
the point was well taken because the success of these agreements will depend to a considerable degree upon the quality of their administration . 
canada can be proud of its record on human rights and should serve as an example of tolerance to other countries . 
whose advice did he follow in making his decision , in that his officials rejected it ? 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased that the Prime Minister has provided the information in the House . 
may I therefore ask the Hon. Member to refrain from any further displays . 
why did the Prime Minister appear prepared to disregard his promise in the first place ? 
Mr. Speaker , I am always amused by these probing questions from the Liberal Party , the Party which says that it would control the deficit . 
surely the Hon. Member is not suggesting that we levy taxes on companies that have been losing money . 
Mr. Speaker , the premise of the question put by the Hon. Member is wrong . 
how many people are employed ( a ) directly or by contract ( b ) full time and part time , in the Office of the Prime Minister ? 
the fees paid to each performer were in keeping with the role played in the gala and with the standards of the Union des Artistes . 
during the Liberal administration nothing was done about it . 
they know about the overproduction problem .
