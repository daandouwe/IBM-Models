each of them is very complex , but the link between the two is even more complex which makes the whole situation for most people understandably confusing . 
the commissionners went on : 
they are constrained by limits which are imposed in order to ensure that the freedom of one person does not violate that of another . 
it made the buying and selling of sex on our streets legal for all intents and purposes . 
the way in which Bill C - 49 has been presented today gives us the feeling that only the prostitutes are punished and stigmatized . 
I never met a street hooker who wanted to be there . 
the establishment of the standing committee by unanimous consent of the House on June 28 , 1985 has already been noted . 
I have stressed the CDC as an example of creative , aggressive effective public ownership . 
so far , around $ 250,000 have been issued by the institute in grants for research or public education activity . 
let me conclude . 
I think we should take a hard look at this justification to determine whether or not it is cost effective and in the public interest . 
however , that raises some very pertinent questions given the cut - backs announced in the Budget last spring . 
we see the licence fee going up from $ 25 to $ 500 . 
it would have been easy to say that these sanctions have to be followed rather than making them voluntary . 
we have to introduce meaningful programs for rehabilitation within our prison system . 
we should count our blessings that we do have a very safe country . 
they , of course , mobilized considerable support across the country . 
what does it mean for a family earning $ 35,000 where the husband and wife both work ? 
I want to make it clear that we have to let this issue come to a vote today . 
the Prime Minister and the Cabinet do not want to spend that money in British Columbia . 
they need toys and entertainment . 
obviously it does not do one bit of good for the poor people in our society . 
I think that is putting it in a very whole context as to what the principles are and what our responsibilities ought to be . 
however , there is no action forthcoming . 
we will have given up so much ground that we will be weaker than we need to be . 
under this Bill it would be unlawful for a passenger in a taxi to ask a driver how to contact a prostitute . 
if they could not pay their fine and no one would raise bail for them they simply stayed in . 
as you are well aware , Mr. Speaker , when Governments act under political pressure , they make bad laws at times . 
this Bill pretends , and I say pretends , to do something about employment equity . 
however , there was essentially no enforcement mechanism or method of ensuring that native people and women really became involved in the process . 
they want to see results . 
treasury Board has been responsible for affirmative action in the Government of Canada for some years now and women have little to show for it . 
women workers are still confined to most of the job ghettos . 
it is very important that we look at employment equity within the federal job - creation programs . 
again yesterday , Mr. Speaker , we saw the Prime Minister ( Mr. Mulroney ) break his word . 
what will be the cost of this particular ruling in terms of lost tax revenue as it is applied to other corporations ? 
as soon as the growers begin to earn inadequate incomes , those who supply the growers and offer support services in the community begin to suffer .
